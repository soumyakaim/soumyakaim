👋 Hi, I’m @soumyakaim a Research Masters Student from University of Groningen. 

👀 I’m interested in understanding the mechanics of psyciactric disorders and their symptoms. 

🌱 I’m currently learning about sensorimotor conflicts and how they can be induced using a robot. 

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on EEG/fNIRS/fMRI/PET studies exploring sensorimotor conflicts, hallucinations and much more. 

📫 Please email me at soumyakaim123@gmail.com if interested.
